# forestcover-type
I took the dataset named forest-cover-type from kaggle. The model simply tells which type of tree is suitable for planting 
in given environmental conditions. The dataset was fine. It had half a million rows. I used different machine learning algos 
for training the model. The best accuracy was given by KNN that is around 96%.
